\section{Program Structure}

To execute my program, type ``python3 Agent.py'', ``python3 Receiver.py'', and ''python3 Sender.py'' in order.

\subsection{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item OS: Arch Linux (4.19.1)
  \item Programming language: Python (3.7.1)
  \item Standard Python3 packages: socket, random
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Configuration}
Default arguments are listed in ``parse\_args'' function in the file ``utils.py.''

\subsection{Program Flow}

\section{Difficulties \& Solutions}
\subsection{Communication between Python and C (i.e. TA's agent.c)}
Integer in Python is not fix-sized.
Saving a Python integer naively, such as using pickle, will result in variable-sized data.
However, 32-bit integer is needed in the ``header'' struct in ``agent.c.''
After searching for a solution, I came across \texttt{to\_bytes} and \texttt{from\_bytes} functions that are meant to encode Python integer into fix-sized data.
Finally, after some trials and errors, I found that specifying \texttt{4}, \texttt{little-Endian} and \texttt{signed=True} in the functions' arguments solves the issue.

\subsection{Loss rate and buffer size}
After finishing ``Sender.py'' and ``Receiver.py'', I realize that my \texttt{winSize} never reaches 3.
At first, I thought there may be some bugs.
However, after reviewing my code, I cannot found any major bugs.
Eventually, I found that the default value of loss rate is too high, and the default value of buffer size is too low.
After setting new default values, the problem is solved.
